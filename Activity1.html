<!-- Why did I Join Code Nation?-->
<div>

    <h4> Why I joined Code Nation </h4>
    <p> Whilst studying for my degree in Aerospace Engineering, I briefly studied APIs on Macros via SolidWorks. This module teased my interest in wanting to pursue a career in the tech sector of engineering. I had originally tried to apply for gradaute opportunities within the technology sector but this was not fruitful and hence vowed to improve my coding skills to create a clearer career path into this field. This was my main motivation for joining Code Nation.</p>
